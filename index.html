                I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him.<br><br>

                A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.<br><br>

                Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company I can't find words how to describe my feelings... For me Apple means a lot -1 got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.<br><br>

                My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well. As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, IPod, and IPad off for one hour. May Steve rest in peace.<br><br>
